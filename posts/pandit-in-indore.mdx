## 🕉️ Our Core Puja Services in Indore (Focus on Home & Harmony)

Pandit Ji specializes in all major pujas performed in homes and temples across Indore. Our focus is on rituals that bring peace, prosperity, and harmony to your family and workspace.

### 1. Griha Pravesh Puja: Blessing Your New Home in Indore

Moving into a new home is a significant milestone. Indore's development means many families are starting fresh in new apartments and colonies. A **Griha Pravesh Puja** is essential to:
* Purify the space of any lingering negative energies.
* Invite divine blessings from Lord Ganesha, Vastu Purusha, and the Navagrahas.
* Ensure the home is filled with peace, health, and prosperity.

**Our Griha Pravesh ceremony is comprehensive and includes:**
* **Vastu Puja:** To honor the Vastu Purusha (spirit of the structure).
* **Ganesh Havan:** To remove all obstacles and bless the new beginning.
* **Navagraha Shanti:** To pacify the nine planets and ensure harmony for all residents.
* **Kalash Sthapana:** Establishing the sacred Kalash to attract divine energy.

### 2. Satyanarayan Katha: For Family Prosperity and Gratitude

The **Satyanarayan Katha** is one of the most beloved and powerful pujas performed in Hindu households. It is an expression of gratitude to Lord Vishnu (as Lord Satyanarayan) and is performed to seek his blessings for success, health, and fulfillment of desires.

**When should you perform Satyanarayan Katha?**
* On auspicious days like Purnima (Full Moon) or Ekadashi.
* After a major life event (new job, promotion, child's birth).
* For birthdays, anniversaries, or before exams.
* Anytime you wish to fill your home with positive vibrations.

Pandit Ji not only recites the Katha but also explains the stories and their moral significance, engaging the entire family in the process.

### 3. Vastu Shanti Puja: Harmonizing Your Living Space

Do you feel a sense of imbalance, stress, or frequent obstacles at home or in your office? This could be due to Vastu doshas (architectural flaws). A **Vastu Shanti Puja** is a powerful remedy that harmonizes the five elements (Earth, Water, Fire, Air, Space) within your property.

This puja is highly recommended for:
* Existing homes and offices where residents face health or financial issues.
* Properties with Vastu defects that cannot be structurally changed.
* Before starting a new business in a commercial space.

Pandit Ji performs a detailed Havan and recites specific mantras to pacify the Vastu Purusha and turn negative energies into positive ones.

### 4. Other In-Home Family Pujas

* **Namkaran Puja (Naming Ceremony):** A child's first and most important sanskara.
* **Mundan Puja (First Haircut):** To bless the child with health and remove impurities.
* **Janmadivas Puja (Birthday):** Performing a small Havan or 'Shanti Paath' on a birthday attracts blessings for the year ahead.
* **Office/Shop Opening Puja:** To ensure a successful and profitable business venture by seeking the blessings of Lord Ganesha and Goddess Lakshmi.
